# Piano SDK for Android

Welcome to Piano SDK for Android.

## Getting started
This document details the process of integrating the Piano SDK with your Android application. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email us at support@piano.io.

### Download the Piano SDK
#### Gradle
The Piano SDK is available as an AAR via jCenter. To add the `api`, `composer`, `oauth`, etc. dependencies, open your projectâ€™s `build.gradle` and update the `repositories` and `dependencies` blocks as follows:
```
repositories {
    // ... other project repositories
    jcenter()
}

// ...

dependencies {
    // ... other project dependencies

    compile 'io.piano.android:api:1.0.0-alpha5'

    compile 'io.piano.android:composer:1.0.0-alpha5'

    compile 'io.piano.android:oauth:1.0.0-alpha5'
}
```

### Usage
#### [API](https://api.tinypass.com/api-docs/dist/index.html)
Initialize `PianoClient` in your Application's `onCreate` method:
```
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    pianoClient = new PianoClient(this, BuildConfig.PIANO_AID, BuildConfig.DEBUG);
}
```

You can configure `BuildConfig.PIANO_AID` in `build.gradle`:
```
defaultConfig {
    applicationId "io.piano.android.sample"
    // ... other project properties

    buildConfigField "String", "PIANO_AID", "\"$aid\""
}
```

`PianoClient` provides underlying methods to APIs. They can be accessed as follows:
```
PianoClient pianoClient = ((PianoSampleApplication) getApplication()).getPianoClient();
List<Access> list = pianoClient.getUserAccessApi().list(pianoClient.getAid());
```

#### [Composer](https://piano.io/composer/)
Take a look at [ComposerActivity](sample/src/main/java/io/piano/android/sample/feature/composer/ComposerActivity.java)

### Sample
We created a sample app to showcase our SDK and highlight some of the features provided by each API.

Don't forget to specify `io.piano.aid=$YOUR_AID` in `piano.properties` in `sample` before you start importing!
